## Accumulated Context

### From Plan 01-04 (PWA Manifest and Assets)

**Implemented:**
- ✅ PWA manifest at `app/manifest.ts` with MetadataRoute.Manifest export
- ✅ App icons in required sizes: 192x192, 512x512, apple-touch-icon (180x180)
- ✅ Favicon for browser tabs
- ✅ Offline fallback page at `/offline` with retry functionality
- ✅ Layout updated with viewport config, theme-color meta, and manifest link
- ✅ Italian (it) set as primary language

**Key Files for Future Phases:**
- `app/manifest.ts` - Update for new PWA features or app metadata changes
- `public/icons/` - Replace with branded icons when available
- `app/offline/page.tsx` - Customize offline message or add offline functionality

**Patterns Established:**
- Next.js 15 manifest.ts automatically generates `/manifest.webmanifest`
- Theme color (#22c55e green) for football field association
- Offline page uses 'use client' for interactivity (retry button)
- Programmatic icon generation with Sharp for consistent branding

### From Plan 01-06 (Theme, i18n, and Onboarding)

**Implemented:**
- ✅ next-intl configuration with Italian (default) and English locales
- ✅ Locale routing with /it/ and /en/ prefixes, middleware chaining with auth
- ✅ next-themes integration with system detection and manual toggle
- ✅ Dark/light theme CSS variables with data-theme attribute
- ✅ 4-step onboarding tutorial with localStorage persistence
- ✅ Complete translation files for navigation, auth, common, onboarding, theme, home

**Key Files for Future Phases:**
- `lib/i18n/routing.ts` - Add new locales here
- `lib/i18n/navigation.ts` - Use Link, useRouter from here for locale-aware navigation
- `messages/it.json` / `messages/en.json` - Add new translations here
- `hooks/use-onboarding.ts` - Reuse for feature-specific onboarding flows
- `components/theme-toggle.tsx` - Reuse in navigation/header components

**Patterns Established:**
- Locale routing: All routes under `/[locale]/` with redirects from root
- Theme switching: next-themes with data-theme attribute for Tailwind v4
- Onboarding: localStorage flag with useOnboarding hook for persistence
- Translations: Nested JSON structure with feature-based keys (auth, navigation, onboarding)

### From Plan 01-05 (Authentication UI)

- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Reference for auth page layout

**Patterns Established:**
- Auth forms use react-hook-form + zodResolver + shadcn/ui
- Italian error messages for all user-facing validation
- Mobile-first: h-12 inputs (48px), centered layout, large touch targets
- Success states built into forms without page navigation

### From Plan 01-03 (Offline Infrastructure)

**Implemented:**
- ✅ IndexedDB schema with Team, Player, Match entities and sync_status
- ✅ Offline action queue with retry logic and error handling
- ✅ Workbox Service Worker with precaching and runtime caching
- ✅ Background Sync for automatic mutation retry

**Key Files for Future Phases:**
- `lib/db/actions.ts` - Use `saveTeam()`, `savePlayer()`, `saveMatch()`, `queueOfflineAction()`
- `hooks/use-offline-queue.ts` - Listen for `SYNC_COMPLETE` messages
- `components/offline-banner.tsx` - Show in root layout for offline status
- `components/service-worker-register.tsx` - Include in root layout

**Patterns Established:**
- All entities have `sync_status: 'synced' | 'pending' | 'error'`
- Offline actions queued with timestamp and retry_count
- SW sends `SYNC_COMPLETE` message to clients after successful sync

### From Research (Critical for Phase 1)

**Architecture Must-Haves:**
1. ✅ Service Worker with Workbox (don't roll your own) - DONE
2. ✅ IndexedDB via `idb` library for offline storage - DONE
3. ✅ Network-first for live data, cache-first for static assets - DONE
4. ✅ NEVER cache real-time match data in SW - DONE (60s TTL on /live/*)
5. ✅ Background sync for queued actions - DONE

**Pitfalls to Avoid (Phase 1):**
- ✅ Pitfall #4: Service Worker caching live match data - SOLVED
- Pitfall #3: Offline-first without conflict resolution (deferred to Phase 6)

**Critical for Mobile:**
- ✅ App shell caching for instant loads - DONE (precacheAndRoute)
- ✅ Offline indicator in UI - DONE (OfflineBanner component)
- ✅ Graceful degradation when offline - DONE (queueOfflineAction)

## Notes

### Mobile-First Reminder
Every feature must be designed for smartphone use first:
- Touch targets 44px minimum
- One-handed operation where possible
- Works in bright sunlight (high contrast)
- Works with wet fingers (large hit areas)
- No hover-dependent interactions

### Offline-First Reminder
Every feature must work without connectivity:
- Cache critical data locally
- Queue mutations for sync
- Show offline status clearly
- Handle sync conflicts gracefully
- Never lose user data

### GDPR Compliance (Ongoing)
- Privacy policy required
- Data deletion capability
- ✅ User consent for notifications (implemented in 03-05)
- Minimal data collection principle
