## Goal

The user wants to replace ALL occurrences of "team" with "club" throughout the entire CalcettoApp project codebase. This includes folder names, file names, variable names, function names, type names, import paths, and translation keys.

## Instructions

- Replace "team" with "club" everywhere in the project
- Also update database references if present (the Prisma schema already uses "club" naming - e.g., `Club`, `ClubMember`, `ClubInvite` models)
- Ensure the build passes after all changes
- Commit and push the changes

## Discoveries

- The project is a Next.js 16.1.6 app with Prisma, PostgreSQL, and next-intl for translations
- The Prisma schema already uses "club" naming (Club, ClubMember, ClubInvite models), but the codebase was using "team" naming
- There are translation files at `messages/en.json` and `messages/it.json` that need both `teams` and `clubs` keys
- Backward compatibility aliases were added to prevent breaking existing imports
- The `types/database.ts` file exports `Team` type which was kept, and `Club` was added as an alias

## Accomplished

**Completed:**
- Renamed `app/[locale]/teams` → `app/[locale]/clubs`
- Renamed `app/api/teams` → `app/api/clubs`
- Renamed `components/teams` → `components/clubs`
- Renamed `hooks/use-teams.ts` → `hooks/use-clubs.ts`
- Renamed `lib/db/teams.ts` → `lib/db/clubs.ts`
- Renamed `lib/validations/team.ts` → `lib/validations/club.ts`
- Renamed `[teamId]` folders to `[clubId]`
- Renamed component files: `team-*.tsx` → `club-*.tsx`
- Updated all imports from `@/teams/...` to `@/clubs/...`
- Updated component names: `TeamCard` → `ClubCard`, `TeamDashboard` → `ClubDashboard`, `TeamForm` → `ClubForm`, `TeamNav` → `ClubNav`, `TeamRosterManager` → `ClubRosterManager`, `TeamImageUploader` → `ClubImageUploader`, `MyTeamsSwitcher` → `MyClubsSwitcher`
- Updated function names in hooks: `useTeam` → `useClub`, `useCreateTeam` → `useCreateClub`
- Added `Club` type export to `lib/db/schema.ts` and `types/database.ts`
- Added backward compatibility aliases (e.g., `export const getUserTeams = getUserClubs`)
- Updated Prisma schema models: `Team` → `Club`, `TeamMember` → `ClubMember`, `PlayerTeam` → `PlayerClub`, `TeamInvite` → `ClubInvite`
- Fixed Prisma schema mapping to correct database table names (`clubs`, `club_members`, `club_invites`, `player_clubs`)
- Fixed raw SQL queries in `statistics.ts` to use `club_id` instead of `team_id`
- Fixed client components calling Prisma directly - now use API calls
- Created `/api/clubs/[clubId]/members` endpoint
- Updated all route paths from `/teams/` to `/clubs/`
- Added redirect for logged-in users from home/auth pages to dashboard
- Updated translation files with `clubs` namespace and keys
- Replaced all "team" → "club" references in translation files (en.json, it.json)
- Updated translation namespace usages from `useTranslations("teams")` to `useTranslations("clubs")`
- Added favicon to public root for proper routing
- Added missing translation keys (`clubs.members`, `settings.clubInfo`, etc.)

**All changes committed and pushed to main branch.**

## Remaining work

- Some translation keys may still need adjustment (e.g., `ourTeam` in goals could be `ourClub` but this refers to "our team" in a match context, not the club entity)
- Test all pages to ensure translations display correctly

## Relevant files / directories

- `app/[locale]/clubs/` - Main clubs pages (renamed from teams)
- `app/api/clubs/` - Clubs API routes (renamed from teams)
- `components/clubs/` - Club components (renamed from teams)
- `hooks/use-clubs.ts` - Clubs hooks (renamed from use-teams.ts)
- `lib/db/clubs.ts` - Club database operations (renamed from teams.ts)
- `lib/validations/club.ts` - Club validation schemas (renamed from team.ts)
- `types/database.ts` - Contains Team and Club type definitions
- `lib/db/schema.ts` - Re-exports types from database.ts
- `messages/en.json` and `messages/it.json` - Translation files with clubs keys
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Prisma schema with Club, ClubMember, PlayerClub, ClubInvite models
